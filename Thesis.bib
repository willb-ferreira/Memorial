The first part of the paper considers the case when treatment effects are estimated by ordinary least-squares. If only treatment labels are randomized, then A-efficient designs are reasonably independent of the correlation structure, but this is not so for other efficiency criteria. If randomization of designs is considered within one of the classical design sets, then restricted randomizations may be chosen to reduce the variations in efficiency. The distributions of the usual sums of squares are also discussed. The second part considers the case when the analysis to be used is generalized least-squares using a known correlation matrix. Then for a particular correlation structure the efficiency orderings are relatively stable over different criteria, but there are important differences between long-range and short-range correlations whatever the criterion. The efficiency gain over ordinary least-squares is shown to be least for long-range structures. Predictions made from theoretical results on the torus (Martin, 1982) are shown to have some validity in the plane. In both parts numerical evaluations provide illustrations.},

Two classes of unilateral models are studied, namely half-space models and causal (quadrant-type) models. It is shown that a number of asymptotic results are common for these models. Of special interest for practical applications is the problem of determining how many parameters should be included to describe the degree of dependence in each direction. Here we are able to obtain weakly consistent generalizations of familiar time-series criteria under the assumption that the generating variables of the model are independently and identically distributed. For causal models we introduce the concepts of spatial innovation process and lattice martingale and use these to extend some of the asymptotic theory to the case where a certain type of dependence is permitted in the generating variables.},

  abstract  = {Gaussian conditional autoregressions have been widely used in spatial statistics and Bayesian image analysis, where they are intended to describe interactions between random variables at fixed sites in Euclidean space. The main appeal of these distributions is in the Markovian interpretation of their full conditionals. Intrinsic autoregressions are limiting forms that retain the Markov property. Despite being improper, they can have advantages over the standard autoregressions, both conceptually and in practice. For example, they often avoid difficulties in parameter estimation, without apparent loss, or exhibit appealing invariances, as in texture analysis. However, on small arrays and in nonlattice applications, both forms of autoregression can lead to undesirable second-order characteristics, either in the variables themselves or in contrasts among them. This paper discusses standard and intrinsic autoregressions and describes how the problems that arise can be alleviated using Dempster's (1972) algorithm or an appropriate modification. The approach represents a partial synthesis of standard geostatistical and Gaussian Markov random field formulations. Some nonspatial applications are also mentioned.},

Perhaps the most straightforward task is that of image restoration, though it is often suggested that this is an area of relatively minor practical importance. The present paper argues the contrary, since many problems in the analysis of spatial data can be interpreted as problems of image restoration. Furthermore, the amounts of data involved allow routine use of computer intensive methods, such as the Gibbs sampler, that are not yet practicable for conventional images. Two examples are given, one in archeology, the other in epidemiology. These are preceded by a partial review of pixel-based Bayesian image analysis.},

  abstract  = {Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in ℝ² only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Matérn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of ℝ d , between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

  abstract  = {Gaussian random fields (GRFs) play an important part in spatial modelling, but can be computationally infeasible for general covariance structures. An efficient approach is to specify GRFs via stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and derive Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) approximations of the solutions. We consider the construction of a class of non-stationary GRFs with varying local anisotropy, where the local anisotropy is introduced by allowing the coefficients in the SPDE to vary with position. This is done by using a form of diffusion equation driven by Gaussian white noise with a spatially varying diffusion matrix. This allows for the introduction of parameters that control the GRF by parametrizing the diffusion matrix. These parameters and the GRF may be considered to be part of a hierarchical model and the parameters estimated in a Bayesian framework. The results show that the use of an SPDE with non-constant coefficients is a promising way of creating non-stationary spatial GMRFs that allow for physical interpretability of the parameters, although there are several remaining challenges that would need to be solved before these models can be put to general practical use.},

  abstract  = {A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or "pixels", each pixel having a particular "colour" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non-degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large-scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly.},

The former, conditional probability definition, whilst the more intuitively attractive, presents several basic problems, not least in the identification of available models. In this paper, conditional probability nearest-neighbour systems for interacting random variables on a two-dimensional rectangular lattice are examined. It is shown that, in the case of 0, 1 variables and a homogeneous system, the only possibility is a logistic-type model but in which the explanatory variables at a point are the surrounding array variables themselves. A spatial-temporal approach leading to the same model is also suggested. The final section deals with linear nearest-neighbour systems, especially for continuous variables. The results of the paper may easily be extended to three or more dimensions.},

A method is given for the estimation of the orders and the coefficients of such models under an identifiability condition and the condition that the beat linear predictor is the best predictor in the mean square sense. Under these conditions, the strong consistency of the estimators ia established. The usual methods for ARMA modelling in Time Series Analysis require estimation of the innovations. The method of this paper introduces an inveree model complementary to the original model so that the estimation of the innovations is avoided. This leads to a substantial reduction in the computational complexity in the two-dimensional case.},

  abstract  = {A random spatial series is a collection of random variables F(xi,⋯ ,xn) depending on several spatial coordinates (x1,⋯ ,xn). An attempt is made to construct a statistical second-order theory of such series when (x1,⋯ ,xn) varies over a regular cartesian lattice. Using the properties of the linear (Hilbert) space associated with the series, the concepts of innovation and purely non-deterministic (p.n.d.) series are introduced. For a p.n.d. series F(x1,⋯ ,xn) a unilateral representation is obtained in terms of a white innovations series Z(y1,⋯ ,yn) where yk≤ xk,k=1,⋯ ,n. The representatation is specialized to the homogeneous case and we discuss spectral conditions for p.n.d. The familiar time-series condition $\int \ \text{log}\ f(\lambda )d\lambda >-\infty $ on the spectral density f is necessary but not sufficient. A sufficient condition is stated. Motivated by the p.n.d. unilateral representation results we define unilateral ARMA (autoregressive-moving average) spatial series models. Stability and invertibility conditions are formulated in terms of the location of zero sets of polynomials relative to the unit polydisc in Cn, and a rigorous shift operator formalism is established. For autoregressive spatial series a Yule-Walker-type matrix equation is formulated and it is shown how this can be used to obtain estimates of the autoregressive parameters. It is demonstrated that under mild conditions the estimates are consistent and asymptotically normal.},
